![Screenshot][5]

This is the [Pygame port] [1] of [Gimix SubOS] [2]. The original version was written in GameMaker 8.1 Lite, and now it's time to move on to bigger and better things.

You can read more about GxSubOS on the [SubOS Wiki] [3].

There is also a [development blog] [4] for this project.

# Installation

To use GxSubOS on an Ubuntu-based system, you will need the following packages installed:
* python-pygame
* git

On Windows, you will need Pygame and [Git for Windows][1] installed.

In either case, you will need Python 2.7 to actually run GxSubOS, done by running the `GxSubOS.py` file.
