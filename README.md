GxSubOS
=======

![Screenshot][5]

This is the [Pygame port][1] of [Gimix SubOS][2]. The original version was written in GameMaker 8.1 Lite, and now it's time to move on to bigger and better things.

You can read more about GxSubOS on the [SubOS Wiki][3].

There is also a [development blog][4] for this project.

# Installation

To use GxSubOS on an Ubuntu-based system, you will need the following packages installed:
* python-pygame
* git

On Windows, you will need [Pygame][1] and [Git for Windows][6] installed. When installing the latter, please ensure that the following option is selected in the installer to allow Git to run from the Windows command prompt (cmd.exe):
![Git for Windows run in cmd option][7]

In either case, you will need Python 2.7 to actually run GxSubOS, done by running the `GxSubOS.py` file.
